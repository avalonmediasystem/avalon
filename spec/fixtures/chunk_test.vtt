Just before lunch one day, a puppet show 
was put on at school.

It was called "Mister Bungle Goes to Lunch".

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.500
It was fun to watch.

In the puppet show, Mr. Bungle came to the 
boys' room on his way to lunch.

6
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.200
He looked at his hands. His hands were dirty 
and his hair was messy.

7
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.100
But Mr. Bungle didn't stop to wash his hands 
or comb his hair.

8
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.900
He went right to lunch.

9
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.700
Then, instead of getting into line at the 
lunchroom, Mr. Bungle pushed everyone aside 
and went right to the front.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Even though this made the children laugh, 
no one thought that was a fair thing to do.
