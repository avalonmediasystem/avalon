A LITTLE more than a hundred years ago, a poor 
man, by the name of Crockett, embarked on board 
an emigrant-ship, in Ireland, for the New World. 
He was in the humblest station in life. But very- 
little is known respecting his uneventful career, 
excepting its tragical close. His family consisted of 
a wife and three or four children. Just before he 
sailed, or on the Atlantic passage, a son was born, to

whom he gave the name of John. The family 
probably landed in Philadelphia, and dwelt some- 
where in Pennsylvania, for a year or two, in one of 
those slab shanties, with which all are familiar as 
the abodes of the poorest class of Irish emigrants. 

After a year or two, Crockett, with his little 
family, crossed the almost pathless Alleghanies. 
Father, mother, and children trudged along through 
the rugged defiles and over the rocky cliffs, on foot. 
Probably a single pack-horse conveyed their few 
household goods. The hatchet and the rifle were 
the only means of obtaining food, shelter, and even 
clothing. With the hatchet, in an hour or two, a 
comfortable camp could be constructed, which would 
protect them from wind and rain. The camp-fire, 
cheering the darkness of the night, drying their 
often wet garments, and warming their chilled 
limbs with its genial glow, enabled them to enjoy 
that almost greatest of earthly luxuries, peaceful 
sleep. 

The rifle supplied them with food. The fattest 
of turkeys and the most tender steaks of venison, 
roasted upon forked sticks, which they held in their 
hands over the coals, feasted their voracious appe- 
tites. This, to them, was almost sumptuous food. 
The skin of the deer, by a rapid and simple pro- 
cess of tanning, supplied them with moccasons, and

afforded material for the repair of their tattered 
garments.
