    abstract: |
      Summary provides a space for describing the contents of the item. Examples 
      include liner notes, contents list, or an opera scene abstract. This field 
      is not meant for cataloger's descriptions but for descriptions that 
      accompany the item. Depending on the length of the summary it may be 
      truncated in search results.
    collection: |
      Collection defines the source or host of the item (for example, the source 
      of the original record or the collection responsible for entering 
      information about the item). Collections will be aggregated for browsing 
      access. Examples: Variations, Indiana University Libraries Film Archive, 
      IUCAT, NUcat.
    contributor: |
      Contributors are persons or bodies associated with the item but not considered
      primary to the creation of its content. Examples of this would be performers in
      a band or opera, conductor, arranger, cinematographer, and choreographer. At
      this time this is no ability to specify a contributor as a corporate body. When
      possible, use the <a href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html"
      target="_blank">Library of Congress Name Authority File</a>.
    creator: |
      <strong>Required field.</strong> Main contributors are the primary persons

      access. At this time there is no ability to specify a main contributor as
      a corporate body. When possible, use the <a
      href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html" target="_blank">Library of
      Congress Name Authority File</a>.
    date_created: |
      Creation date should only be used if Date is a re-issue date. Then Creation date

      options shown in <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/pre-
      submission.html" target="_blank">Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) 1.0</a>.
    title: |
      <strong>Required field.</strong> Title is used for display in search results and
      single item views. Recommended use is to reflect the content captured in
      digitized media files (such as the title of the piece performed or a short
      description of the content of a home movie). Lengthy titles may be truncated in
      the search results view.
    topical_subject: |
      Subject should be used for the topical subject of the content. For
      consistency and to allow for sorting and aggregating, use terms from the
      <a href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html"
      target="_blank">Library of Congress Subject Headings</a>. For temporal
      subjects, use the Time period(s) field and for geographic subjects, use
      the Location(s) field in this form. See below.
  role_help:
    manager: |
      Managers have overall accountability for the collection. Managers can 
      create collections and assign editor and depositor roles for those 
      collections. They set the default access controls for items added to 
      the collection, and they also step in when a published item needs 
      revising or deleting. Managers can also do anything an editor or 
      depositor can do.
    editor: |
      Editors have supervisory responsibility for the collection building â€” the 
      ingest and description process. They can assign depositor roles, change 
      the name or description of the collection, and can modify the access 
      controls for individual items in the collection. Editors can also do 
      anything a depositor can do.
    depositor: |
      Depositors add media to the collection and describe it with metadata. 
      They can publish items but not unpublish. They can only modify or 
      delete unpublished items.
