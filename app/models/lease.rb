# Base Class for controlling access to Avalon content or groups via date restricted groups (Lease)
# @since 5.0.0
# @attr [DateTime] begin_time The date and time a lease begins
#                  Set to today on save if it is has not been set
#                  Always set to the supplied date (or default of today) and 00:00:00 UTC for the time on save (start of that day UTC time)
