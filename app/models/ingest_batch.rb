#
#  In master file update:

#  if ingest_batch && ! ingest_batch.email_sent? && ingest_batch.finished?
#    IngestBatchMailer.status_email(ingest_batch.id).deliver
#    ingest_batch.email_sent = true
#  end

#  attr_accessible :media_object_ids, :name, :email, :email_sent
  serialize :media_object_ids

  attr_reader :media_objects
