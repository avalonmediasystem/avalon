 * This is the default theme. You can modify many of the settings
 * by editing your local app/assets/stylesheets/blacklight_themes/standard.css
 *
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Require stylesheets for our gems
 *
 *= require jquery-ui/datepicker
 *= require datatables
 *
 * Require all of our vendored stylesheets
 *= require_tree ../../../vendor/assets/stylesheets/.

 * Exclude MediaElement4 CSS in /vendor as it collides w/ MEJS2 styles
 *= stub mediaelement/mediaelementplayer.css
 *= stub mediaelement/plugins/quality.css

 *= require_self
