# This job is primarily intended for use within an AWS or similar environment
# When a new spreadsheet is uploaded S3 will trigger an AWS Lambda, which in
# turn queues the job below.
#
# Note that is is not required for AWS, but is cleaner.  The other option is
# to take the `avalon:batch:ingest` from `config/schedule.rb` and alter it to
# scan a selected S3 Bucket (or buckets) and then add it to `cron.yaml`
#
#
# Secondly please review:
# https://github.com/nulib/avalon/wiki/Throttling-Batch-Ingest-on-AWS
# for performance related issues that may arise depending on your AWS config
